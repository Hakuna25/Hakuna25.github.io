Hi, there! Here's Xueqian. I'm currently a first-year master student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/). Before coming to UC San Diego, I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 2024. My research interests include soft robot design, reinforcement learning and machine learning. 
<!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
